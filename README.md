# Yamaha Soundbar

This component allows you to control Yamaha soundbar.

Tested on Yamaha YAS-109 & YAS-209, any Yamaha soundbar based on Linkplay A118 should be supported as well. (These include ATS-1090, ATS-2090, SR-X40A, SR-X50A, ATS-X500, Please make an issue in Github if you have a different model and it's not working, or even better if it is, so we can update the compatibility list.)

## Installation

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=osk2&repository=yamaha-soundbar&category=integration)

## Upgrading from version 3.1.9 and earlier.

If you are upgrading from version 3.1.9 or earlier:
#### 1. You will need to remove the old integration which is /custom_components/linkplay/ and then install the new integration.
#### 2. You will need to update the platform configuration to `yamaha_soundbar` from `linkplay` in your `configuration.yaml` file.
