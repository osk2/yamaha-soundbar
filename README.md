# Linkplay-based speakers and sound devices

This component allows you to integrate control of audio devices based on Linkplay chipset into your [Home Assistant](http://www.home-assistant.io) smart home system. Originally developed by nicjo814, maintained by limych. This version mostly rewritten by nagyrobi. Read more about Linkplay at the bottom of this file.

Fully compatible with [Mini Media Player card for Lovelace UI](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-media-player) by kalkih, including speaker group management.

## Installation
[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)
* Install using HACS, or manually: copy all files in `custom_components/linkplay` to your `<config directory>/custom_components/linkplay/` directory.
* Restart Home-Assistant.
* Add the configuration to your configuration.yaml.
* Restart Home-Assistant again.

**Breaking change from v2:** After upgrading to v3 the configured devices will be re-added to HA with a new unique identifier tied to 
the hardware UUID of the Linkplay modules, instead of IP address. This will result in having the original
entity_id of the preiously configured devices _disabled_ and having added as new with entity_id _2 or similar.

This can be easily fixed in Home Assistant, visit your entites list, click the old entity_id and delete it.
Then click the newly generated entity_id _2 and name it back to what preiously was. Your automations can remain unchanged.

### Configuration

It is recommended to create static DHCP leases in your network router to ensure the devices always get the same IP address. Recent models versions allow setting static IP address, if you see that option, use it.

To add Linkplay units to your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file:

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
media_player:
    - platform: linkplay
      host: 192.168.1.11
      name: Sound Room1
      volume_step: 10
      icecast_metadata: 'StationNameSongTitle'
      multiroom_wifidirect: False
      sources: 
        {
          'optical': 'TV sound', 
          'line-in': 'Radio tuner', 
          'bluetooth': 'Bluetooth',
          'udisk': 'USB stick',
          'http://94.199.183.186:8000/jazzy-soul.mp3': 'Jazzy Soul',
        }

    - platform: linkplay
      host: 192.168.1.12
      name: Sound Room2
      uuid: 'FF31F09E82A6BBC1A2CB6D80'
      icecast_metadata: 'Off'  # valid values: 'Off', 'StationName', 'StationNameSongTitle'
      sources: {}
      common_sources: !include linkplay-radio-sources.yaml
```

### Configuration Variables

**host:**  
  *(string)* *(Required)* The IP address of the Linkplay unit.

**name:**  
  *(string)* *(Required)* Name that Home Assistant will generate the `entity_id` based on. It is also the base of the friendly name seen in the dashboard, but will be overriden by the device name set in the Android app.

**volume_step:**  
  *(integer)* *(Optional)* Step size in percent to change volume when calling `volume_up` or `volume_down` service against the media player. Defaults to `5`, can be a number between `1` and `25`. 

**sources:**  
  *(list)* *(Optional)* A list with available source inputs on the device. If not specified, the integration will assume that all the supported source input types are present on it:
```yaml
'bluetooth': 'Bluetooth', 
'line-in': 'Line-in', 
'line-in2': 'Line-in 2', 
'optical': 'Optical', 
'co-axial': 'Coaxial', 
'HDMI': 'HDMI', 
'udisk': 'USB disk', 
'TFcard': 'SD card', 
'RCA': 'RCA', 
'XLR': 'XLR', 
'FM': 'FM', 
'cd': 'CD'
```
The sources can be renamed to your preference (change only the part _after_ **:** ). You can also specify http-based (Icecast / Shoutcast) internet radio streams as input sources:
```yaml
'http://1.2.3.4:8000/your_radio': 'Your Radio',
'http://icecast.streamserver.tld/mountpoint.aac': 'Another radio'
```
If you don't want a source selector to be available at all, set option to empty: `sources: {}`.

_Note:_ **Don't** use HTTP**S** streams. Linkplay chipsets seem to have limited supporrt for HTTPS. Besides, using HTTPS is useless in practice for a public webradio stream, it's a waste of computig resources for this kind of usage both on server and player side.

**common_sources:**  
  *(list)* *(Optional)* Another list with sources which should appear on the device. Useful if you have multiple devices on the network and you'd like to maintain a common list of http-based internet radio stream sources for all of them in a single file with `!include linkplay-radio-sources.yaml`. The included file should be in the same place as the main config file containing `linkplay` platform.   
  For example:
```yaml
{
  'http://1.2.3.4:8000/your_radio': 'Your Radio',
  'http://icecast.streamserver.tld/mountpoint.aac': 'Another radio'
}
```

**icecast_metadata:**  
  *(string)* *(Optional)* When playing icecast webradio streams, how to handle metadata. Valid values here are `'Off'`, `'StationName'`, `'StationNameSongTitle'`, defaulting to `'StationName'` when not set. With `'Off'`, Home Assistant will not try do request any metadata from the IceCast server. With `'StationName'`, Home Assistant will request only once when starting the playback the stream name from the headers, and display it in the `media_title` property of the player. With `'StationNameSongTitle'` Home Assistant will request the stream server periodically for icy-metadata, and read out `StreamTitle`, trying to figure out correct values for `media_title` and `media_artist`, in order to gather cover art information from LastFM service (see below). Note that metadata retrieval success depends on how the icecast radio station servers and encoders are configured, if they don't provide proper infos or they don't display correctly, it's better to turn it off or just use StationName to save server load. There's no standard way enforced on the servers, it's up to the server maintainers how it works.

**lastfm_api_key:**  
  *(string)* *(Optional)* API key to LastFM service to get album covers. Register for one.

**multiroom_wifidirect:**  
  *(boolean)* *(Optional)* Set to `True` to override the default router mode used by the component with wifi-direct connection mode (more details below).

**uuid:**  
  *(string)* *(Optional)* Hardware UUID of the player. Can be read out from the attibutes of the entity. Set it manually to that value to handle double-added entity cases when Home Assistant starts up without the Linkplay device being on the network at that moment.

**led_off:**  
  *(boolean)* *(Optional)* Set to `True` to turn off the LED on the front panel of the Arylic devices (works only for this brand).


## Multiroom

Linkplay devices support multiroom in two modes:
- WiFi direct mode, where the master turns into a hidden AP and the slaves connect directly to it. The advantage is that this is a dedicated direct connection between the speakers, with network parameters optimized by the factory for streaming. Disadvantage is that switching of the stream is slower, plus the coverage can be limited due to the building's specifics. _This is the default method used by the Android app to create multirooms._
- Router mode, where the master and slaves connect to each other through the local network (from firmware `v4.2.8020` up). The advantage is that all speakers remain connected to the existing network, swicthing the stream happens faster, and the coverage can be bigger being ensured by the network infrastructure of the building (works through multiple interconnected APs and switches). Disadvantage is that the network is not dedicated and it's the user responsibility to provide proper network infrastructure for reliable streaming. _This only works through this component and it's the preferred mode._

This integration will autodetect the firmware version running on the player and choose multiroom mode accordingly. Units with firmware version lower than `v4.2.8020` can connect to multirooms _only in wifi-direct mode_. Firmware version number can be seen in device attributes. If the user has a mix of players running old and new firmware, autodetection can be overriden with option `multiroom_wifidirect: True`, and is needed only for units with newer versions, to force them down to wifi-direct multiroom.

To create a multiroom group, connect `media_player.sound_room2` (slave) to `media_player.sound_room1` (master):
```yaml
    - service: linkplay.join
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.sound_room2
        master: media_player.sound_room1
```
To exit from the multiroom group, use the entity ids of the players that need to be unjoined. If this is the entity of a master, all slaves will be disconnected:
```yaml
    - service: linkplay.unjoin
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.sound_room1
```
These services are compatible out of the box with the speaker group object in @kalkih's [Mini Media Player](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-media-player) card for Lovelace UI.

It's also possible to use Home Assistant's [standard multiroom](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/media_player/#service-media_playerjoin) join and unjoin functions for multiroom control.

*Tip*: if you experience temporary `Unavailable` status on the slaves afer unjoining from a multiroom group in router mode, run once the Linkplay-specific command `RouterMultiroomEnable` - see details further down.

## Snapshot and restore

To prepare the player to play TTS and save the current state of it for restoring afterwards, current playback will stop:
```yaml
    - service: linkplay.snapshot
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.sound_room1
```
To restore the player state:
```yaml
    - service: linkplay.restore
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.sound_room1
```
You can specify multiple entity ids separated by comma or use `all` to run the service against. Currently the following state is being snapshotted/restored:
- Volume
- Input source
- Webradio stream (as long as it's configured as an input source)
- USB audio files playback (track will restart from the beginning)
- Spotify (snapshot will use the device's highest preset number to store and recall the current playlist, playback may restart the same track or not, depends on Spotify settings. Note: You have to first manually store at least a preset first with the app).

If you experience TTS audio being cut off at the beginning, this is because the player needs some time to switch to playing out the stream. The only good solution for this is to add a configurable amount of silence at the beginning of the audio stream, I've modified [Google Translate](https://github.com/nagyrobi/home-assistant-custom-components-google_translate) and [VoiceRSS](https://github.com/nagyrobi/home-assistant-custom-components-voicerss) to do this, they can be installed manually as custom components.

## Presets

Linkplay devices allow to save, using the control app on the phone/tablet, music presets (for example Spotify playlists) to be recalled for later listening. Recalling a preset from Home Assistant:
```yaml
    - service: linkplay.preset
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.sound_room1
        preset: 1
```
Preset count vary from device type to type, usually the phone app shows how many presets can be stored maximum. The integration detects the max number and the command only accepts numbers from the allowed range. You can specify multiple entity ids separated by comma or use `all` to run the service against.

## Specific commands

Linkplay devices support some commands through the API, this is a wrapper to be able to use these in Home Assistant:
```yaml
    - service: linkplay.command
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.sound_room1
        command: TimeSync
        notify: False
```
Implemented commands:
- `PromptEnable` and `PromptDisable` - enable or disable the audio prompts played through the speakers when connecting to the network or joining multiroom etc.
- `"WriteDeviceNameToUnit: My Device Name"` - change the friendly name of the device both in firmware and in Home Assistant. Needs to be in qoutes.
- `"SetApSSIDName: NewWifiName"` - change the SSID name of the AP created by the unit for wifidirect multiroom connections. Needs to be in qoutes.
- `SetRandomWifiKey`- perhaps as an extra security feature, one could make an automation to change the keys on the APs to some random values periodically.
- `TimeSync` - is for units on networks not connected to internet to compensate for an unreachable NTP server. Correct time is needed for the alarm clock functionality (not implemented yet here).
- `RouterMultiroomEnable` - router mode is available by default in firmwares above v4.2.8020, but there’s also a logic included to build it up, this command ensures to set the good priority. Only use if you have issues with multiroom in router mode.
- `MCU+XXX+XXX` - passthrough for direct TCP UART commands [supported by the module](https://forum.arylic.com/t/home-assistant-integratio-available/729/23). Input not validated, use at your own risk.
- `Rescan` - do not wait for the current 60 second throttle cycle to reconnect to the unavailable devices, trigger testing for availability immediately.

If parameter `notify: False` is omitted, results will appear in Lovelace UI's left pane as persistent notifications which can be dismissed. You can specify multiple entity ids separated by comma or use `all` to run the service against.

## Automation examples

Play a sound file located on an http server or a webradio stream:
```yaml
    - service: media_player.play_media
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.sound_room1
        media_content_id: 'http://icecast.streamserver.tld/mountpoint.mp3'
        media_content_type: url
```

Play the first sound file located on the local storage directly attached to the device (folder\files order seen by the chip seems to be alphabetic):
```yaml
    - service: media_player.play_media
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.sound_room1
        media_content_id: '1'
        media_content_type: music
```

Select an input and set volume and unmute via an automation:
```yaml
- alias: 'Switch to the line input of the TV when TV turns on'
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: media_player.tv_room1
      to: 'on'
  action:
    - service: media_player.select_source
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.sound_room1
        source: 'TV sound'
    - service: media_player.volume_set
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.sound_room1
        volume_level: 1
    - service: media_player.volume_mute
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.sound_room1
        is_volume_muted: false
```
Note that you have to specify source names as you've set them in the configuration of the component.

Intrerupt playback of a source, say a TTS message and resume playback afterwards:
```yaml
- alias: 'Notify by TTS that Mary has arrived'
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: person.mary
      to: 'home'
  action:
    - service: linkplay.snapshot
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.sound_room1
    - service: media_player.volume_set
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.hang_nappali
        volume_level: 0.8
    - service: tts.google_translate_say
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.sound_room1
        message: 'Mary arrived home'
    - delay: '00:00:02'
    - service: linkplay.restore
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.sound_room1
```
Note the `delay`, that should be equal or more with the time it takes for the TTS to spkeak out the text, usually that's an average of 1 second for every 3 words spoken out.
